# Repository instructions

## Project

- This is the trusted, unsandboxed Paseo plugin `paseo-graphite`.
- Keep `paseo-plugin.json`, `package.json`, the README compatibility badge, and install commands aligned.
- Read the current plugin docs at <https://paseo.sh/docs/plugins> and <https://paseo.sh/docs/plugins/reference> before changing runtime code.

## Code boundaries

- `index.client.tsx` and `index.server.ts` wire contributions and RPC handlers.
- `client/` is React Native UI, `server/` owns subprocess and filesystem work, and `shared/` contains cross-runtime contracts.
- Invoke `git`, `gt`, and `gh` without a shell and never interpolate repository data into shell commands.
- Paseo supplies SDK, React, React Native, TanStack Query, and Zod at runtime. Keep those packages in `devDependencies`.
- Never commit credentials, daemon state, logs, or local paths.

## Verification and release

- Run `npm ci`, `npm run verify`, and `npm pack --dry-run` after changes.
- Do not restart the Paseo daemon. Use `paseo plugin reload paseo-graphite` for an installed development copy.
- Publish only from a clean `main`, after confirming the packed file list and auditing it for secrets.
- Tag the exact published commit as `vX.Y.Z`; never move a published tag.
